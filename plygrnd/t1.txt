ITEM 2   MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GENERAL COMMENTS  OVERVIEW  Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to expand the U.S. economy. We are the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates, primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel. We also are a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete as well as a leading producer of cement in Florida.  Demand for our products is dependent on construction activity. The primary end uses include public construction, such as highways, bridges, airports, schools and prisons, as well as private nonresidential (e.g., manufacturing, retail, offices, industrial and institutional) and private residential construction (e.g., single-family houses, duplexes, apartment buildings and condominiums). Customers for our products include heavy construction and paving contractors; commercial building contractors; concrete products manufacturers; residential building contractors; state, county and municipal governments; railroads and electric utilities.  We operate primarily in the United States and our principal product  aggregates  is used in virtually all types of public and private construction projects and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases, must be produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the materials. Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available high quality aggregates. We serve these markets from inland quarries  shipping by barge and rail  and from our quarry on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. We transport aggregates from Mexico to the U.S. principally on our three Panamax-class, self-unloading ships.  There are practically no substitutes for quality aggregates. Because of barriers to entry created by zoning and permitting regulation and because of high transportation costs relative to the value of the product, the location of reserves is a critical factor to long-term success.  While aggregates is our primary business, we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products, such as asphalt mix and concrete, can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate acceptable financial returns. We produce and sell asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete primarily in our mid-Atlantic, Georgia, Florida, southwestern and western markets. Aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix by weight and 78% of ready-mixed concrete by weight. In all of these downstream businesses, we supply virtually all of the required aggregates from our own operations.  SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS  Almost all our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector. The levels of construction spending are affected by changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations.  23  Table of Contents EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR FIRST QUARTER 2012       Net sales increased $43.5 million, or 10%, from the prior year reflecting sales growth in every segment         Unit shipments increased in every major product line, including a 10% increase in aggregates shipments         Aggregates segment net sales increased $22.7 million, reflecting higher shipments       Gross profit increased $29.1 million and gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales increased 6 percentage points (600 basis points) from the first quarter of 2011 reflecting the favorable earnings effect of improved productivity and cost reduction         Gross profit from the Aggregates segment increased $23.3 million, reflecting higher shipments as well as lower unit cost of sales due to improved productivity         All key labor and energy efficiency metrics for the Aggregates segment improved for the quarter, and more than offset an 11% increase in the unit cost of diesel fuel         Gross profit from the non-aggregates segments improved by $5.8 million, reflecting cost reduction initiatives       Earnings from continuing operations were a loss of $0.44 per diluted share as compared to a loss of $0.50 per share in the first quarter of 2011         First quarter 2012 results include a charge of $0.05 per diluted share related to the unsolicited exchange offer from Martin Marietta and a gain of $0.03 per diluted share on the sale of real estate in California         First quarter 2011 results include a benefit of $0.12 per diluted share related to a recovery from legal settlement         Adjusting for the aforementioned items, earnings from continuing operations were a loss of $0.42 per diluted share as compared to a loss of $0.62 per diluted share in the same period last year       EBITDA was $42.0 million, a 36% increase from the first quarter of 2011         Excluding first quarter of 2012s $10.1 million of costs related to the unsolicited exchange offer and $6.0 million gain related to the sale of real estate in California and first quarter of 2011s $25.5 million of gain related to the recovery from legal settlement, Adjusted EBITDA increased to $46.1 million in the first quarter of 2012 from $5.3 million in the prior year       Selling, administrative and general (SAG) expenses were $12.6 million, or 16%, lower than in the prior year         SAG expenses were lower due mainly to cost reduction initiatives undertaken in 2011  Our aggregates business delivered another quarter of strong improvement and the non-aggregates businesses continued to make progress. These results reflect the continued recovery of our markets and the benefits of our strong earnings leverage. In particular, higher aggregates shipments and lower unit cost of sales drove a 6.4 percentage point (640 basis point) improvement in Aggregates segment gross profit as a percentage of segment revenues. Demand for our products was solid during the quarter due primarily to public infrastructure projects and some recovery in private sector construction work. Results in the quarter were aided by favorable weather conditions. Our focus on improving earnings through price and cost leadership, and the continued execution of the Profit Enhancement Plan and Planned Asset Sales, position us to further benefit from a recovery in demand in 2012.  During the quarter, we made steady progress on the Profit Enhancement Plan announced in February. We have identified and begun to prioritize further opportunities for savings in General and Administrative (G&A), sourcing, and transportation and logistics. As a result, we are on track to improve our profitability (as measured by EBITDA) by $100 million annually at current volumes. As previously reported, $25 million is expected to be achieved in 2012, $75 million in 2013 and the full $100 million in 2014. These enhancements would be in addition to the $55 million in run-rate overhead reductions achieved through actions in 2011.  In addition, we continue to implement the Planned Asset Sales announced in February and are pleased with the level of interest and activity surrounding the process. Sales will be made from a broad portfolio of assets that are not central to our strategy. We continue to expect net proceeds of approximately $500 million from the sale of assets by mid-2013.  We remain focused on executing our initiatives, which will generate higher levels of earnings and cash flow, further improve our operating leverage, reduce overhead costs and strengthen our credit profile  all of which will enable us to restore a meaningful dividend as rapidly as possible. In summary, we are very encouraged in the continued signs of recovery we are seeing in the construction sector of the U.S. economy and in our businesses. We believe that we have tremendous upside  24  Table of Contents  potential as the economy improves and we continue reaping the benefits of strategic investments we have made in our ERP system and through our Profit Enhancement Plan.  RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) does not define free cash flow and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). Thus, free cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity measure defined by GAAP and EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP. We present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analysis, and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions. The investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a company's ability to incur and service debt. We use free cash flow, EBITDA and other such measures to assess the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company. We do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources. Reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest GAAP measures are presented below:  FREE CASH FLOW  Free cash flow deducts purchases of property, plant & equipment from net cash provided by operating activities.    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA  EBITDA is an acronym for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 25  Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost. This presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review results of operations. We discuss separately our discontinued operations, which consist of our former Chemicals business.  The following table shows net earning in relationship to net sales, cost of goods sold, operating earnings, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] FIRST QUARTER 2012 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER 2011  First quarter net sales were $499.9 million, up 10% from the first quarter of 2011. Shipments were up in all major products: aggregates +10%, ready-mixed concrete +12%, asphalt mix +3% and cement +23%. The average unit sales price increased in all products with the exception of aggregates where a less favorable product mix resulted in a 1% decline in overall pricing.  Results for the first quarter were a net loss of $52.1 million or $0.40 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $54.7 million or $0.42 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011. Gross profit increased $29.1 million reflecting the growth in net sales coupled with lower unit costs despite a $3.1 million unfavorable diesel price variance. The current quarters results include a pretax charge of $10.1 million related to the unsolicited exchange offer and a $6.0 million gain related to the sale of real estate in California while the first quarter 2011 results include a pretax gain of $25.5 million related to the recovery from legal settlement (see Note 18 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).  26  Table of Contents CONTINUING OPERATIONS  Changes in loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the first quarter of 2012 versus the first quarter of 2011 are summarized below:  LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] Gross profit for the Aggregates segment was $34.0 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $10.7 million in the first quarter of 2011. Growth in aggregates shipments across almost all geographic markets coupled with lower unit cost of sales led to a sharp increase in this segments gross profit margin (9.6% vs. 3.2%) as a percentage of segment revenues. Aggregates shipments increased 10% from the prior year. Our aggregates businesses in California and Virginia continued to achieve strong volume gains from the prior year. Our aggregates businesses in eight other states also achieved double-digit volume gains over the prior years first quarter, most notably key states of Florida, Texas and Alabama. These increases were due mainly to large infrastructure project work  primarily highways  some improvement in private construction activity and favorable weather conditions. The average sales price for aggregates decreased 1% from the prior years first quarter due mostly to a less favorable product mix. All key labor productivity and energy efficiency metrics improved from the prior year, more than offsetting an 11% increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel.  The Concrete segment gross profit was a loss of $12.3 million versus a loss of $14.4 million in the prior year. Ready-mixed concrete volumes increased 12% from the prior year. The average sales price increased 1% from the prior year, contributing to improved unit materials margin.  Asphalt Mix segment gross profit was a loss of $0.6 million, approximating the prior years break-even earnings. The average sales price for asphalt mix increased 6%, offsetting most of the earnings effect of a 16% increase in liquid asphalt cost. Asphalt mix volume increased 3% from the prior years first quarter.  The Cement segment gross profit was $0.9 million, an improvement of $4.1 million from the prior year due to increased volumes and lower operating costs.  SAG expenses in the first quarter were $12.6 million lower than the prior year benefitting from the cost reduction initiatives undertaken in 2011.  Gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses was $6.5 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2011. This increased gain resulted primarily from the sale of real estate in California.  The $25.5 million in recovery from a legal settlement included in the prior years first quarter results reflects an arbitration award from insurers related to the lawsuit settled in 2010 with the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT). For additional details, see Note 18 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  The $10.1 million of exchange offer costs in the current years first quarter reflects legal, professional and other costs incurred in response to an unsolicited exchange offer. For additional details, see Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  27  Table of Contents Net interest expense was $52.3 million in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $42.3 million in the first quarter of 2011. This increase was due primarily to higher interest rates, and somewhat to a higher level of debt, stemming from the June 2011 debt refinancing. In June 2011, we replaced $725.0 million of debt accruing interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR with debt accruing interest at a weighted-average fixed rate of 7.05%  We recorded income tax benefits from continuing operations of $38.4 million (40.2% effective tax rate) in the first quarter of 2012 compared to $37.4 million (36.7% effective tax rate) in the first quarter of 2011. In both of these quarters, we were required to apply the year-to-date effective tax rate methodology to calculate the income tax benefit as discussed in Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. The $1.0 million increase in the tax benefit was due principally to our recognition in the first quarter of 2011 of unfavorable discrete income tax adjustments partially offset by the reduced pretax loss in the first quarter of 2012.  Results from continuing operations were a loss of $0.44 per diluted share compared to a loss of $0.50 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2011.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  First quarter 2012 pretax earnings from discontinued operations of $8.2 million were a result of a $10.2 million 5CP earn-out gain (net of transaction costs) partially offset by general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs associated with our former Chemicals business. First quarter 2011 pretax earnings from discontinued operations of $16.4 million were a result of an $11.1 million 5CP earn-out gain (net of transaction costs) and a $7.5 million pretax gain on recovery from an insurer in a lawsuit involving perchloroethylene. These first quarter 2011 earnings were partially offset by general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs. For additional details, see Note 2 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities, a bank line of credit and access to the capital markets. Additional financial resources include the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate, and dispositions of non-strategic operating assets. We believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund our future business requirements, including:       cash contractual obligations       capital expenditures       debt service obligations       potential future acquisitions       dividend payments  We actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk. We seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles:       maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing capacity       use the bank line of credit only for seasonal working capital requirements and other temporary funding requirements       proactively manage our long-term debt maturity schedule such that repayment/refinancing risk in any single year is low       avoid financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility       opportunistically access the capital markets when conditions and terms are favorable  28  Table of Contents CASH  Included in our March 31, 2012 cash and cash equivalents balance of $191.2 million is $46.3 million of cash held at one of our foreign subsidiaries. The vast majority of this $46.3 million of cash relates to earnings prior to January 1, 2012 and would not be available to fund domestic operations because earnings prior to January 1, 2012 are permanently reinvested offshore.  CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  Net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings before deducting noncash charges for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization.    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] As noted in the table above, net cash provided by operating activities was down $15.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period of 2011. At $33.1 million, net earnings before noncash deductions for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization for the first quarter of 2012 was essentially flat compared to the $35.9 million in the first quarter of 2011. Cash provided by changes in assets and liabilities before initial effects of business acquisitions and dispositions decreased $22.6 million in 2012 compared to the same three month period of 2011. A significant improvement in sales resulted in a comparative increase in accounts and notes receivable which more than accounted for the $22.6 million decrease.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  Net cash provided by investing activities was $3.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012, a $14.7 million increase compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase in investing cash flow resulted largely from $10.2 million of higher proceeds from sale of property, plant & equipment and a $5.4 million reduction in purchases of property, plant & equipment.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.4 million during the three months ended March 31, 2012, an increase of $19.9 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. This increase in financing cash flow resulted largely from a $31.0 million reduction in dividends paid (dividend rate of $0.01 per share vs. $0.25 per share) partially offset by a $14.5 million decrease in net short-term borrowings.  29  Table of Contents DEBT  Our weighted-average interest rates, total debt as a percentage of total capital and percentage of floating and fixed rate debt are summarized below:    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 1 As restated for March 31, 2011, see Note 1 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  Our $144.7 million of current maturities of long-term debt as of March 31, 2012 is due as follows:    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] We expect to retire the current maturities using existing cash, cash generated from operations, or by drawing on our bank line of credit.  During the fourth quarter of 2011, we replaced our $1.5 billion bank line of credit that was due to expire on November 16, 2012 with a $600.0 million bank line of credit. We proactively reduced the size of the bank line of credit to match the current and expected needs of the business  the $1.5 billion bank line of credit was established in connection with the acquisition of Florida Rock and the initial borrowings were largely refinanced with other debt instruments.  The $600.0 million bank line of credit expires on December 15, 2016 and is secured by certain domestic accounts receivable and inventory. Borrowing capacity fluctuates with the level of eligible accounts receivable and inventory and may be less than $600.0 million at any point in time.  Utilization of the borrowing capacity under our bank line of credit as of March 31, 2012:       none was drawn       $66.6 million was used to provide backup for outstanding standby letters of credit  30  Table of Contents Borrowings under the $600.0 million bank line of credit bear interest at a rate determined at the time of borrowing equal to the lower of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% based on the level of utilization, or an alternative rate derived from the lenders prime rate. Borrowings bearing interest at LIBOR plus the margin are made for periods of 1, 2, 3 or 6 months, and may be extended. Borrowings bearing interest at an alternative rate are made on an overnight basis and may be extended each day. Letters of credit issued under the $600.0 million bank line of credit are charged a fee equal to the applicable margin for borrowings. As of March 31, 2012, the applicable margin was 1.75%.  Borrowings under the $600.0 million bank line of credit are classified as long-term debt due to our ability to extend borrowings at the end of each borrowing period. Previously, we classified bank line of credit borrowings as short-term debt based on our intent to pay outstanding borrowings within one year.  In June 2011, we issued $1.1 billion of long-term notes in two series, as follows: $500.0 million of 6.50% notes due in 2016 and $600.0 million of 7.50% notes due in 2021. These notes were issued principally to:       repay and terminate our $450.0 million floating-rate term loan due in 2015       fund the purchase through a tender offer of $165.4 million of our outstanding 5.60% notes due in 2012 and $109.6 million of our outstanding 6.30% notes due in 2013       repay $275.0 million outstanding under our bank line of credit       and for general corporate purposes  This debt issuance and retirement transaction lengthens our debt maturity profile and provides financial flexibility to continue investing in our business as the economy recovers.  DEBT COVENANTS  The $600.0 million bank line of credit contains covenant limitations on liens, indebtedness, guarantees, certain restricted payments, and acquisitions and divestitures, and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that is only applicable if utilization exceeds 90% of the lesser of $600.0 million or the borrowing capacity derived from the sum of eligible accounts receivable and inventory.  The indentures governing our notes contain a covenant limiting our total debt as a percentage of total capital to 65%. Our total debt as a percentage of total capital was 42.9% as of March 31, 2012, compared with 42.6% as of December 31, 2011 and 41.2% as of March 31, 2011.  DEBT RATINGS  Our short-term debt rating/outlook as of March 31, 2012 was:       Moodys  not prime/negative (rating dated September 16, 2011; outlook changed from stable to negative)  In October 2011, Standard and Poors withdrew our short-term debt rating/outlook at our request. The rating (B/negative) was deemed unnecessary as we had no outstanding commercial paper and access to the commercial paper market was unavailable at the current credit rating.  Our long-term debt ratings/outlooks as of March 31, 2012 were:       Standard and Poors  BB/watch positive (rating dated December 13, 2011; outlook changed from negative to watch positive)       Moodys  Ba2/negative (rating dated September 16, 2011; downgraded from Ba1/stable)  Subsequent to the December 2011 unsolicited exchange offer from Martin Marietta, Moodys placed our ratings under review with direction uncertain.  31  Table of Contents EQUITY  Our common stock issuances are summarized below:    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] In the first quarter of 2011, we issued 0.4 million shares of common stock in connection with a business acquisition as explained in Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  We periodically sell shares of common stock to the trustee of our 401(k) savings and retirement plan to satisfy the plan participants' elections to invest in our common stock. This arrangement provides a means of improving cash flow, increasing equity and reducing leverage. Under this arrangement, the stock issuances and resulting cash proceeds for the periods presented were:       three months ended March 31, 2012  no shares issued       twelve months ended December 31, 2011  issued 0.1 million shares for cash proceeds of $4.7 million       three months ended March 31, 2011  no shares issued  There were no shares held in treasury as of March 31, 2012, December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2011. There were 3,411,416 shares remaining under the current purchase authorization of the Board of Directors as of March 31, 2012.  STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT  For a discussion of our standby letters of credit see Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  CASH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  Our obligation to make future payments under contracts is presented in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  We follow certain significant accounting policies when preparing our consolidated financial statements. A summary of these policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011 (Form 10-K).  We prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may differ from these estimates.  32  Table of Contents We believe that the accounting policies described in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Form 10-K require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies during the three months ended March 31, 2012.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  For a discussion of the accounting standards recently adopted or pending adoption and the affect such accounting changes will have on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity, see Note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

The run-rate earnings effect is expected to be achieved within the next 18 months as we fully leverage our streamlined management structure and substantially completed ERP and Shared Services platforms. These profit enhancements are in addition to the actions announced in 2011, which produced the $55 million in run-rate overhead savings as cited above.     Planned Asset Sales with net after-tax proceeds of approximately $500 million from the sale of non-core assets over the next 12 to 18 months. The net proceeds of these sales, together with the increased earnings resulting from the Profit Enhancement Plan, will be used to reduce debt and strengthen our balance sheet and credit profile. The intended asset sales are consistent with our strategic focus on building leading aggregates positions in markets with above-average long-term demand growth.  CORRECTION OF PRIOR PERIOD  FINANCIAL STATEMENT  In preparation for an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) exam during 2011, we identified improper deductions and errors in the calculation of taxable income for items primarily associated with the 2007 acquisition of Florida Rock. The errors arose during periods prior to 2009 and are not material to previously issued financial statements. As a result, we did not amend previously filed financial statements but have restated the affected Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statements of Equity presented in this Form 10-K. See Note 20 Correction of Prior Period Financial Statement in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more details.  STABILIZING MARKETS  For the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2011, contract awards for highway construction, which include federal, state and local road and bridge projects, were down 6% from 2010 in Vulcan-served states. However, contract awards for more aggregates-intensive road-related projects were up 2% over 2010 while bridges were down 18% compared to 2010. We believe this sharp contrast between road and bridge contract award activity is due to the types of projects funded with federal stimulus dollars as well as the increase in spending from regular funding programs by state departments of transportation, which in the absence of a new multi-year federal highway bill are currently more focused on maintaining existing capacity.  Several developments in Congress offer encouragement that federal highway funding is moving in a positive direction. The current six-month funding extension, which was signed into law September 16, 2011, is essentially in line with 2011 funding levels. Notably, leaders in Congress in both parties have been working to maintain highway funding at or very near current levels at a time of dramatic proposed or actual cuts in many other areas of the federal budget. The first three appropriations bills of fiscal year 2012 included appropriations for highways at more than $41 billion, consistent with the last two fiscal year funding levels. With respect to the reauthorization of the multi-year surface transportation bill, both Senate and House leaders have stated their intention to move a highway bill in 2012, and began floor debate on bills in the House and Senate the week of February 14, 2012.  Private construction in the U.S. has remained at low levels with some indications of improvement in certain categories. Single-family housing starts remain at historically low levels. Multi-family housing starts, on the other hand, have increased sharply since late last year. Private nonresidential construction has also remained at low levels; however, trailing twelve-month contract awards are up across the U.S. for the fourth quarter in a row. The growth in contract awards in the manufacturing sector has remained strong since late 2010, and awards for new projects in the categories of retail and office buildings have increased modestly for the third consecutive quarter.   Part II   31 Table of Contents UNSOLICITED EXCHANGE OFFER  In December 2011, Martin Marietta commenced an unsolicited exchange offer for all outstanding shares of our common stock at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.50 shares of Martin Marietta common stock for each Vulcan common share and indicated its intention to nominate a slate of directors to our Board. After careful consideration, including a thorough review of the offer with its financial and legal advisors, our Board unanimously determined that Martin Mariettas offer is inadequate, substantially undervalues Vulcan, and is not in the best interests of Vulcan and its shareholders.  More information regarding our Boards recommendation and rationale can be found in the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov.  RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) does not define free cash flow and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA). Thus, they should not be considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities or any other liquidity or earnings measure defined by GAAP. We present these metrics for the convenience of investment professionals who use such metrics in their analyses, and for shareholders who need to understand the metrics we use to assess performance and to monitor our cash and liquidity positions. The investment community often uses these metrics as indicators of a companys ability to incur and service debt. We use free cash flow, EBITDA and other such measures to assess the operating performance of our various business units and the consolidated company. We do not use these metrics as a measure to allocate resources. Reconciliations of these metrics to their nearest GAAP measures are presented below:  FREE CASH FLOW  Free cash flow deducts purchases of property, plant & equipment from net cash provided by operating activities.    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] EBITDA  EBITDA is an acronym for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization.    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  Part II   32 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Net sales and cost of goods sold exclude intersegment sales and delivery revenues and cost. This presentation is consistent with the basis on which we review results of operations. We discuss separately our discontinued operations, which consist of our former Chemicals business.  The following table shows net earnings in relationship to net sales, cost of goods sold, operating earnings and EBITDA.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] OPERATING LEVERAGE EMBEDDED IN OUR BUSINESS  The EBITDA rebound in 2011 demonstrated the operating leverage embedded in our business as demand recovers. We expect this momentum to continue in 2012 due primarily to the continuation of a stable demand environment, continued improvement in pricing and our continued focus on:     reducing overhead costs through streamlined management structure     reducing debt     improving our liquidity position and earnings through divestitures of non-strategic assets or other strategic alternatives  Since 2007, we have invested $61.7 million in expense and capital to implement our new ERP and Shared Services platforms. We initiated the project to create a common platform for all systems that support our business, and have completed all of the major milestones for the project since then. These platforms are helping to streamline processes enterprise-wide and standardize administrative and support functions while providing enhanced flexibility to monitor and control costs.  These new platforms enabled us to consolidate our eight divisions into four regions, streamline our support function, and reduce related positions and overhead costs  resulting in annualized overhead cost savings of over $55 million. As a result of these restructuring initiatives, we incurred $13.0 million of severance and related charges during 2011.   Part II   33 Table of Contents To position Vulcan for significant earnings growth, we remain focused on taking prudent steps to control costs, improve liquidity and continue to adjust our product mix and geographic footprint.  We completed several transactions in 2011 that increased our aggregates reserves positions in key markets while improving earnings and liquidity by exiting certain non-strategic markets. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we plan to sell noncore assets that will generate after-tax net proceeds of approximately $500 million. The intended asset sales are consistent with our strategic focus on building leading aggregates reserve positions in markets with above-average long-term demand growth.  The 2011 results include a $46.4 million recovery from legal settlements reflecting arbitration awards from insurers related to the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) lawsuit settled last year for $40.0 million. In addition to these recovery amounts, the arbitration awards included $3.2 million of current year legal fees and interest.  Year-over-year changes in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes are summarized below:    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]    1   Includes expenses for property donations recorded at fair value for each comparative year, as follows: $0.0 million in 2011, $9.2 million in 2010 and $8.5 million in 2009.  OPERATING RESULTS BY SEGMENT  We present our results of operations by segment at the gross profit level. We have four reporting segments organized around our principal product lines: 1) Aggregates, 2) Concrete, 3) Asphalt Mix and 4) Cement. Management reviews earnings for the product line segments principally at the gross profit level.  1. AGGREGATES  Our year-over-year aggregates shipments declined:     3% in 2011     2% in 2010     26% in 2009  Despite the year-over-year decline, shipments in the second half of 2011 trended upward primarily due to strength in California and the Mid-Atlantic markets. The increases in these markets were due mainly to large infrastructure project work (principally highway construction) and favorable weather.   Part II   34 Table of Contents Our year-over-year freight-adjusted selling price for aggregates:     improved 1% in 2011     declined 2% in 2010     improved 3% in 2009  The average sales price for aggregates increased 1% from the prior year due to improvements across a number of markets, including Florida, Tennessee and Texas and certain markets in California.  AGGREGATES REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] Aggregates gross profit remained relatively stable due mostly to improved pricing and cost containment through productivity gains in labor and energy efficiency. Labor productivity and energy efficiency, both key operating measures, improved from the prior year and more than offset a 35% increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel.   Part II   35 Table of Contents 2. CONCRETE  Our year-over-year ready-mixed concrete shipments declined:     6% in 2011     5% in 2010     32% in 2009  The Concrete segment reported a loss of $43.4 million in 2011 compared to a loss of $45.0 million in 2010. Ready-mixed concrete volumes were down 6% while the average sales price increased 6%, contributing to a 10% improvement in unit materials margin.  CONCRETE REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS  3. ASPHALT MIX  Our year-over-year asphalt mix shipments:     increased 1% in 2011     declined 3% in 2010     declined 22% in 2009  Asphalt Mix gross profit was $25.6 million in 2011 compared to $29.3 million in 2010 due principally to higher liquid asphalt costs. The average sales price for asphalt mix increased 8% while liquid asphalt costs increased 17%.  ASPHALT MIX REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS   Part II   36 Table of Contents 4. CEMENT  The average unit selling price for cement decreased 7% and volumes were down 5% in 2011 compared to 2010 contributing to the $0.7 million reduction in gross profit.  CEMENT REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS  SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND  GENERAL EXPENSES  SAG expenses decreased $37.5 million, or 11%, from 2010. This 2011 decrease resulted from lower spending in most major overhead categories, including lower spending for our IT replacement project and the absence of a charge in the current year for property donations. Additionally, the current year expenses included savings from reduced employment levels.  Our comparative company employment levels at year end:     declined 7% in 2011     declined 4% in 2010     declined 11% in 2009  SAG expenses for property donations recorded at fair value were as follows: $0.0 million in 2011, $9.2 million in 2010 and $8.5 million in 2009. The gains from these donations, which are equal to the excess of the fair value over the carrying value, are included in gain on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Excluding the effect of these property donations, SAG expenses decreased $28.3 million in 2011 over 2010 and increased $5.2 million in 2010 over 2009.  Severance charges included in SAG expenses were as follows: 2011  $4.1 million, 2010  $6.9 million and 2009  $7.3 million.   Part II   37 Table of Contents GAIN ON SALE OF PROPERTY, PLANT &  EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET  The 2011 gain includes a $39.7 million pretax gain associated with the sale of four non-strategic aggregates facilities and a $0.6 million pretax gain associated with an exchange of assets (see Note 19 Acquisitions and Divestitures in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data). The 2010 gain includes a $39.5 million pretax gain associated with the sale of three non-strategic aggregates facilities. The 2009 gain was primarily related to sales and donations of real estate.  INTEREST EXPENSE  The 2011 increase in interest expense resulted primarily from our debt refinancing completed in June. In addition to higher effective interest rates on the new debt, we incurred $26.2 million of charges in connection with our tender offer and debt retirement. These charges resulted from the $18.4 million difference between the purchase price and par value of the notes purchased in the tender offer, $0.7 million in transaction fees and $8.1 million of noncash write-offs of unamortized discounts, deferred financing costs and amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to the retired debt.  INCOME TAXES  Our income tax benefit from continuing operations for the years ended December 31 is shown below:    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] The $11.2 million decrease in our 2011 benefit from income taxes is primarily related to the 2011 decreased loss from continuing operations. The $51.8 million increase in our 2010 benefit from income taxes is primarily related to the increased loss from continuing operations. A reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to our effective tax rates for 2011, 2010 and 2009 is presented in Note 9 Income Taxes in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.   Part II   38 Table of Contents DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  Pretax earnings from discontinued operations were:     $7.4 million in 2011     $10.0 million in 2010     $19.5 million in 2009  The 2011 pretax earnings includes pretax gains totaling $18.6 million related to the 5CP earn-out and insurance recoveries compared to similar pretax gains totaling $13.9 million in 2010. The 2009 pretax earnings from discontinued operations resulted primarily from settlements with two of our insurers in perchloroethylene lawsuits resulting in pretax gains of $23.5 million. These gains were partially offset by general and product liability costs, including legal defense costs, and environmental remediation costs. For additional information regarding discontinued operations and the 5CP earn-out, see Note 2 Discontinued Operations in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by our operating activities, a bank line of credit and access to the capital markets. Additional financial resources include the sale of reclaimed and surplus real estate, and dispositions of non-strategic operating assets. We believe these financial resources are sufficient to fund our future business requirements, including:     cash contractual obligations     capital expenditures     debt service obligations     potential future acquisitions     dividend payments  On October 14, 2011, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of one cent per share for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the 25 cents per share quarterly dividend paid in the third quarter of 2011. On February 15, 2012, our Board declared a dividend of one cent per share for the first quarter of 2012.  We actively manage our capital structure and resources in order to minimize the cost of capital while properly managing financial risk. We seek to meet these objectives by adhering to the following principles:     maintain substantial bank line of credit borrowing capacity     use the bank line of credit only for seasonal working capital requirements and other temporary funding requirements     proactively manage our long-term debt maturity schedule such that repayment/refinancing risk in any single year is low     avoid financial and other covenants that limit our operating and financial flexibility     opportunistically access the capital markets when conditions and terms are favorable   Part II   39 Table of Contents CASH  Included in our cash and cash equivalents balance of $155.8 million is $40.1 million of cash held at one of our foreign subsidiaries. This cash is not available to fund domestic operations unless repatriated. We have no plans to repatriate the cash as the earnings from this subsidiary are indefinitely reinvested. If we distribute the earnings in the form of dividends, the distribution would be subject to U.S. income taxes.  CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  Net cash provided by operating activities is derived primarily from net earnings before deducting noncash charges for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization.    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 2011 VERSUS 2010  Although net earnings before noncash deductions for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization increased to $290.9 million from $285.6 million, net cash provided by operating activities decreased $33.7 million. Operating cash flows were negatively impacted by changes in our working capital accounts which used $25.3 million in cash in 2011 compared to $37.2 million of cash generated in 2010. This increase in cash outflows was partially offset by a decrease in contributions to pension plans from $24.5 million in 2010 to $4.9 million in 2011.  2010 VERSUS 2009  Lower net earnings before deducting noncash charges for depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization caused the majority of the $250.3 million decrease in operating cash flows. Cash received associated with gains on sale of property, plant & equipment and businesses is presented as a component of investing activities and accounts for $40.2 million of the $250.3 million year-over-year decrease in operating cash flows.   Part II   40 Table of Contents CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  2011 VERSUS 2010  Net cash used for investing activities of $19.5 million decreased $68.9 million from 2010. Proceeds from the sale of non-strategic businesses increased $23.8 million year-over-year to $74.7 million in 2011. We utilized an asset swap strategy to acquire aggregates facilities in high growth markets while disposing of non-strategic assets. This strategy allowed us to acquire net assets valued at $35.4 million for a cash outlay of $10.5 million. Accordingly, cash used to acquire businesses decreased by $60.0 million compared to 2010. Cash used for the purchase of property, plant & equipment totaled $98.9 million in 2011, compared to $86.3 million in 2010 and $109.7 million in 2009.  2010 VERSUS 2009  Net cash used for investing activities totaled $88.4 million compared to $80.0 million in 2009, an increase of $8.4 million. The positive cash flows from an increase in proceeds from the sale of non-strategic businesses of $34.9 million and the decrease in cash used for capital projects were more than offset by a $33.6 million increase in payments for businesses acquired and a $33.3 million decrease in the redemption of medium-term investments.  CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  2011 VERSUS 2010  Net cash used for financing activities of $41.3 million decreased $47.8 million from 2010. Increases in financing cash flows were largely due to an increase in cash flows related to debt of $71.5 million. This net positive cash flow variance includes proceeds and payments of short-term and long-term debt, debt issuance costs, cash paid to purchase our own debt at a premium above par value and proceeds from the settlement of interest rate swap agreements. The positive cash flows from debt-related items and the $29.6 million decrease in dividends paid (largely as a result of the dividend reduction in the fourth quarter of 2011) were partially offset by year-over-year decreases in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options totaling $53.7 million.  2010 VERSUS 2009  Net cash used for financing activities totaled $89.1 million, compared to $361.0 million during 2009. During 2010, we reduced total debt by $19.8 million despite a significant year-over-year decline in cash provided by operating activities. In the third quarter of 2009, we reduced our dividend per share to $0.25 from $0.49 declared and paid in the prior two quarters of 2009, resulting in comparative cash savings of $91.9 million during 2010.   Part II   41 Table of Contents DEBT    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] In June 2011, we issued $1.1 billion of long-term notes in two series, as follows: $500.0 million of 6.50% notes due in 2016 and $600.0 million of 7.50% notes due in 2021. These notes were issued principally to:     repay and terminate our $450.0 million floating-rate term loan due in 2015     fund the purchase through a tender offer of $165.4 million of our outstanding 5.60% notes due in 2012 and $109.6 million of our outstanding 6.30% notes due in 2013     repay $275.0 million outstanding under our bank line of credit     and for general corporate purposes  This debt issuance and retirement transaction lengthens our debt maturity profile and provides financial flexibility to continue investing in our business as the economy recovers.  During the fourth quarter of 2011, we replaced our $1.5 billion bank line of credit that was due to expire on November 16, 2012 with a $600.0 million bank line of credit. We proactively reduced the size of the bank line of credit to match the current and expected needs of the business  the $1.5 billion bank line of credit was established in connection with the acquisition of Florida Rock and the initial borrowings were largely refinanced with other debt instruments.  The $600.0 million bank line of credit expires on December 15, 2016 and is secured by certain domestic accounts receivable and inventory. Borrowing capacity fluctuates with the level of eligible accounts receivable and inventory and may be less than $600.0 million at any point in time.  Utilization of the borrowing capacity under our bank line of credit as of December 31, 2011:     none was drawn     $63.8 million was used to provide backup for outstanding standby letters of credit   Part II   42 Table of Contents Borrowings under the $600.0 million bank line of credit bear interest at a rate determined at the time of borrowing equal to the lower of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25% based on the level of utilization, or an alternative rate derived from the lenders prime rate. Borrowings bearing interest at LIBOR plus the margin are made for periods of 1, 2, 3 or 6 months, and may be extended. Borrowings bearing interest at an alternative rate are made on an overnight basis and may be extended each day. Letters of credit issued under the $600.0 million bank line of credit are charged a fee equal to the applicable margin for borrowings. As of December 31, 2011, the applicable margin was 1.75%.  Borrowings under the $600.0 million bank line of credit are classified as long-term debt due to our ability to extend borrowings at the end of each borrowing period. Previously, we classified bank line of credit borrowings as short-term debt based on our intent to pay outstanding borrowings within one year.  As of December 31, 2011, debt maturities for the next five years were as follows:    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] We expect to retire debt maturities using existing cash, cash generated from operations, by drawing on our bank line of credit, or accessing the capital markets.  DEBT COVENANTS  The $600.0 million bank line of credit contains covenant limitations on liens, indebtedness, guarantees, certain restricted payments, and acquisitions and divestitures, and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio that is only applicable if utilization exceeds 90% of the lesser of $600.0 million or the borrowing capacity derived from the sum of eligible accounts receivable and inventory.  The indentures governing our notes contain a covenant limiting our total debt as a percentage of total capital to 65%. Our total debt as a percentage of total capital was 42.6% as of December 31, 2011 compared with 40.7% as of December 31, 2010.  DEBT RATINGS  Our short-term debt rating/outlook as of December 31, 2011 was:     Moodys  not prime/negative (rating dated September 16, 2011; outlook changed from stable to negative)  In October 2011, Standard and Poors withdrew our short-term debt rating/outlook at our request. The rating (B/negative) was deemed unnecessary as we had no outstanding commercial paper and access to the commercial paper market was unavailable at the current credit rating.  Our long-term debt ratings/outlooks as of December 31, 2011 were:     Standard and Poors  BB/watch positive (rating dated December 13, 2011; outlook changed from negative to watch positive)     Moodys  Ba2/negative (rating dated September 16, 2011; downgraded from Ba1/stable)  Subsequent to the December 2011 unsolicited exchange offer from Martin Marietta, Moodys placed our ratings under review with direction uncertain.   Part II   43 Table of Contents EQUITY  Our common stock outstanding increased 0.7 million shares from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011.    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] In 2009, we sold 13.2 million shares of common stock (par value of $1 per share) in a public offering for net proceeds of $520.0 million.  As explained in more detail in Note 13 Equity in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, common stock issued in connection with business acquisitions were:     2011  0.4 million shares     2009  0.8 million shares  We periodically sell shares of common stock to the trustee of our 401(k) savings and retirement plan to satisfy the plan participants elections to invest in our common stock. This arrangement provides a means of improving cash flow, increasing equity and reducing leverage. Under this arrangement, the stock issuances and resulting cash proceeds for the years ended December 31 were:     2011  issued 0.1 million shares for cash proceeds of $4.7 million     2010  issued 0.9 million shares for cash proceeds of $41.7 million     2009  issued 1.1 million shares for cash proceeds of $52.7 million  In 2010, we issued 1.2 million shares of common stock (par value of $1 per share) to our qualified pension plans as explained in Note 10 Benefit Plans in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This transaction increased equity by $53.9 million (common stock $1.2 million and capital in excess of par $52.7 million).  There were no shares held in treasury as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. There were 3,411,416 shares remaining under the current purchase authorization of the Board of Directors as of December 31, 2011.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, such as financing or unconsolidated variable interest entities, that either have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our:     results of operations     financial position     liquidity     capital expenditures     capital resources   Part II   44 Table of Contents STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT  For a discussion of our standby letters of credit see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  CASH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  We expect cash requirements for income taxes of $5.8 million during 2012. Additionally, we have a number of contracts containing commitments or contingent obligations that are not material to our earnings. These contracts are discrete and it is unlikely that the various contingencies contained within the contracts would be triggered by a common event. Excluding future cash requirements for income taxes and these discrete in nature contracts, our obligations to make future contractual payments as of December 31, 2011 are summarized in the table below:    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]    1  Bank line of credit represents borrowings under our five-year credit facility which expires December 15, 2016.     2  Noncapital unconditional purchase obligations relate primarily to transportation and electrical contracts.     3  Payments in "Thereafter" column for benefit plans are for the years 2017-2021.     4  The above table excludes discounted asset retirement obligations in the amount of $154.0 million at December 31, 2011, the majority of which have an estimated settlement date beyond 2016 (see Note 17 "Asset Retirement Obligations" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data").     5  The above table excludes unrecognized income tax benefits in the amount of $13.5 million at December 31, 2011, as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payment of these uncertain tax positions (for more details, see Note 9 "Income Taxes" in Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data").   Part II   45 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  We follow certain significant accounting policies when we prepare our consolidated financial statements. A summary of these policies is included in Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  We prepare these financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions we believe reasonable under existing circumstances and evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. The results of these estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates.  We believe the following seven critical accounting policies require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:  1. Goodwill and goodwill impairment  2. Impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill  3. Reclamation costs  4. Pension and other postretirement benefits  5. Environmental compliance  6. Claims and litigation including self-insurance  7. Income taxes  1. GOODWILL AND  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of net assets acquired in business combinations over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill impairment exists when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because goodwill is material to our total assets (as of December 31, 2011, goodwill represents 38% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. Thus, an impairment charge could be material to our financial condition and results of operations.  OUR ASSUMPTIONS  We base our fair value estimates on market participant assumptions we believe to be reasonable at the time, but such assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Changes in key assumptions or management judgment with respect to a reporting unit or its prospects may result from a change in market conditions, market trends, interest rates or other factors outside of our control, or significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results. These conditions could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in an impairment charge in the future.  The significant assumptions in our discounted cash flow models include our estimate of future profitability, capital requirements and the discount rate. The profitability estimates used in the models were derived from internal operating budgets and forecasts for long-term demand and pricing in our industry. Estimated capital requirements reflect replacement capital estimated on a per ton basis and acquisition capital necessary to support growth estimated in the models. The discount rate was derived using a capital asset pricing model.   Part II   46 Table of Contents HOW WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT  Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two-step process. We have identified 13 reporting units that represent operations or groups of operations one level below our operating segments.  STEP 1  We compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill     if the fair value exceeds its carrying value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired     if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we go to step two to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any  STEP 2  We compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by hypothetically allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable assets and liabilities in a manner consistent with a business combination, with any excess fair value representing implied goodwill.     if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess  HOW WE DETERMINE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE  First, we determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities, including goodwill, to those units as of the measurement date. Then, we estimate the fair values of the reporting units by considering the indicated fair values derived from both an income approach, which involves discounting estimated future cash flows, and a market approach, which involves the application of revenue and EBITDA multiples of comparable companies. Finally, we consider market factors when determining the assumptions and estimates used in our valuation models. To substantiate the fair values derived from these valuations, we reconcile the implied fair values to our market capitalization.  RESULTS OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS  The results of our annual impairment tests for:     November 1, 2011 indicated that the fair values of one of our reporting units with $1,815.1 million of goodwill exceeded its carrying value by 8%. The fair values of all other reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values (see further discussion below)     November 1, 2010 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values     November 1, 2009 indicated that the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill substantially exceeded their carrying values  The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flows (DCF) model of the aggregates reporting unit for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by 8% were growth rates for volume, price and variable costs to produce, capital requirements and the discount rate. Based on our historical experience and macroeconomic forecasts for each of the counties that are served by our operations, we developed projections for volume, price and cost growth rates. Subsequently, projections were revised downwards to reflect assumptions that we believe a market participant, not privy to our internal information, would make based on information available through normal and customary due diligence procedures. Accordingly, the DCF model assumes that over a twenty year projection period volumes, pricing and variable cost grow at inflation-adjusted (real) average annual rates of 4.8%, 0.9% and 0.7%, respectively. Our capital spending assumptions are based on the level of projected volume and our historical experience. For goodwill impairment testing purposes, we utilized a 9.50% discount rate to present value the estimated future cash flows.  The market approach was based on multiples of revenue and EBITDA to enterprise value for comparative public companies. The six data points (derived from the revenue and EBITDA multiples for the past three years, trailing twelve months and analysts estimates for next year) were averaged to arrive at the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.  Delays in a sustained recovery in our Gulf Coast markets may result in an impairment of this reporting units goodwill.   Part II   47 Table of Contents For additional information regarding goodwill, see Note 18 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  2. IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  EXCLUDING GOODWILL  We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment evaluation is a critical accounting policy because long-lived assets are material to our total assets (as of December 31, 2011, net property, plant & equipment represents 42% of total assets, while net other intangible assets represents 8% of total assets) and the evaluation involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions and considerable management judgment. Thus, an impairment charge could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The carrying value of long-lived assets is considered impaired when the estimated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than their carrying value. In that event, we recognize a loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets.  Fair value is determined by primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires considerable management judgment and long-term assumptions. Our estimate of net future cash flows is based on historical experience and assumptions of future trends, which may be different from actual results. We periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.  We test long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. As a result, our long-lived asset impairment test is at a significantly lower level than the level at which we test goodwill for impairment. In markets where we do not produce downstream products (e.g. ready-mixed concrete and asphalt mix), the lowest level of largely independent identifiable cash flows is at the individual aggregates operation or a group of aggregates operations collectively serving a local market. Conversely, in vertically integrated markets, the cash flows of our downstream and upstream businesses are not largely independently identifiable as the selling price of the upstream products (aggregates and cement) determines the profitability of the downstream business.  Long-lived asset impairments during 2011 were immaterial and related to property abandonments. During 2010 we recorded a $3.9 million loss on impairment of long-lived assets. The loss on impairment was a result of the challenging construction environment which impacted non-strategic assets across multiple operating segments. There were no long-lived asset impairments during 2009.  For additional information regarding long-lived assets and intangible assets, see Note 4 Property, Plant & Equipment and Note 18 Goodwill and Intangible Assets in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  3. RECLAMATION COSTS  Reclamation costs resulting from normal use of long-lived assets are recognized over the period the asset is in use only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon retirement of the assets. Additionally, reclamation costs resulting from normal use under a mineral lease are recognized over the lease term only if there is a legal obligation to incur these costs upon expiration of the lease. The obligation, which cannot be reduced by estimated offsetting cash flows, is recorded at fair value as a liability at the obligating event date and is accreted through charges to operating expenses. This fair value is also capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the underlying asset and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset. If the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability, a gain or loss is recognized on settlement.  Reclamation costs are considered a critical accounting policy because of the significant estimates, assumptions and considerable management judgment used to determine the fair value of the obligation and the significant carrying amount of these obligations ($154.0 million as of December 31, 2011).  HOW WE DETERMINE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATION  To determine the fair value of the obligation, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation tasks including a reasonable profit margin. This cost is then increased for both future estimated inflation and an estimated   Part II   48 Table of Contents  market risk premium related to the estimated years to settlement. Once calculated, this cost is discounted to fair value using present value techniques with a credit-adjusted, risk-free rate commensurate with the estimated years to settlement.  In estimating the settlement date, we evaluate the current facts and conditions to determine the most likely settlement date. If this evaluation identifies alternative estimated settlement dates, we use a weighted-average settlement date considering the probabilities of each alternative.  We review reclamation obligations at least annually for a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Additionally, reclamation obligations are reviewed in the period that a triggering event occurs that would result in either a revision to the cost or a change in the estimated settlement date. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the cost include a new reclamation law or amendment of an existing mineral lease. Examples of events that would trigger a change in the estimated settlement date include the acquisition of additional reserves or the closure of a facility.  For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Note 17 Asset Retirement Obligations in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  4. PENSION AND OTHER  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  Accounting for pension and postretirement benefits requires that we make significant assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. Each year we review our assumptions about the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase (for salary-related plans) and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits.     DISCOUNT RATE  The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future     EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS  We project the future return on plan assets based principally on prior performance and our expectations for future returns for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term asset allocation of the plan. These projected returns reduce the recorded net benefit costs     RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE  For salary-related plans only, we project employees annual pay increases, which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement     RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE BENEFITS  We project the expected increases in the cost of covered healthcare benefits  HOW WE SET OUR ASSUMPTIONS  In selecting the discount rate, we consider fixed-income security yields, specifically high-quality bonds. We also analyze the duration of plan liabilities and the yields for corresponding high-quality bonds. At December 31, 2011, the discount rates for our various plans ranged from 4.15% to 5.08%.  In estimating the expected return on plan assets, we consider past performance and long-term future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long-term allocation of plan assets to these investments. At December 31, 2011, the expected return on plan assets remained consistent with 2010 at 8.0% and was down from 8.25% in 2009.  In projecting the rate of compensation increase, we consider past experience and future expectations. At December 31, 2011, our projected weighted-average rate of compensation remained 3.50%.  In selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits, we consider past performance and forecasts of future healthcare cost trends. At December 31, 2011, our assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was 7.50% for 2012, decreasing each year until reaching 5.0% in 2017 and remaining level thereafter.   Part II   49 Table of Contents Changes to the assumptions listed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations, the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities, and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost. The following table reflects the favorable and unfavorable outcomes associated with a change in certain assumptions:    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] As of December 31, 2008, our Master Pension Trust had assets invested at Westridge Capital Management, Inc. (WCM) with a reported fair value of $59.2 million. In February 2009, the New York District Court appointed a receiver over WCM due to allegations of fraud and other violations of federal commodities and securities laws by principals of a WCM affiliate. In light of these allegations, we reassessed the fair value of our investments at WCM and recorded a $48.0 million write-down in the estimated fair value of these assets for the year ended December 31, 2008. During 2011, the fair value of assets increased from $630.3 million to $636.6 million due primarily to the recovery of an additional $22.0 million from WCMs court-appointed receiver. This recovery resulted in the recognition of a $10.8 million return on plan assets (net of the $11.2 million remaining WCM investment). During 2010, WCM receipts included a $6.6 million release from the receiver as a partial distribution and a $15.0 million insurance settlement for the loss.  During 2012, we expect to recognize net periodic pension expense of approximately $37.0 million and net periodic postretirement expense of approximately $11.6 million compared to $25.7 million and $11.7 million, respectively, in 2011. The increase in pension expense is due primarily to the decrease in the discount rate and the change to reflect generational mortality improvement. For the qualified pension plans, the increase in pension expense is also due to lower than expected asset returns in 2011. As a result of our 2010 pension contributions of $72.5 million in March and $1.3 million in July, we do not expect to make any contributions to the funded pension plans during 2012. Assuming actuarial assumptions are realized, existing funding credit balances are sufficient to fund projected minimum required contributions through 2012. We currently do not anticipate that the funded status of any of our plans will fall below statutory thresholds requiring accelerated funding or constraints on benefit levels or plan administration.  For additional information regarding pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 10 Benefit Plans in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  5. ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE  Our environmental compliance costs include the cost of ongoing monitoring programs, the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs.  HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS  To account for environmental costs, we:     expense or capitalize environmental costs consistent with our capitalization policy     expense costs for an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future revenues     accrue costs for environmental assessment and remediation efforts when we determine that a liability is probable and we can reasonably estimate the cost   Part II   50 Table of Contents At the early stages of a remediation effort, environmental remediation liabilities are not easily quantified due to the uncertainties of various factors. The range of an estimated remediation liability is defined and redefined as events in the remediation effort occur. When we can estimate a range of probable loss, we accrue the most likely amount. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. As of December 31, 2011, the difference between the amount accrued and the maximum loss in the range for all sites for which a range can be reasonably estimated was $4.1 million.  Accrual amounts may be based on technical cost estimations or the professional judgment of experienced environmental managers. Our Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Management Committee routinely reviews cost estimates, including key assumptions, for accruing environmental compliance costs; however, a number of factors, including adverse agency rulings and encountering unanticipated conditions as remediation efforts progress, may cause actual results to differ materially from accrued costs.  For additional information regarding environmental compliance costs, see Note 8 Accrued Environmental Remediation Costs in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  6. CLAIMS AND LITIGATION  INCLUDING SELF-INSURANCE  We are involved with claims and litigation, including items covered under our self-insurance program. We are self-insured for losses related to workers compensation up to $2.0 million per occurrence and automotive and general/product liability up to $3.0 million per occurrence. We have excess coverage on a per occurrence basis beyond these retention levels.  Under our self-insurance program, we aggregate certain claims and litigation costs that are reasonably predictable based on our historical loss experience and accrue losses, including future legal defense costs, based on actuarial studies. Certain claims and litigation costs, due to their unique nature, are not included in our actuarial studies. For matters not included in our actuarial studies, legal defense costs are accrued when incurred.  HOW WE ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF LOSS  We use both internal and outside legal counsel to assess the probability of loss, and establish an accrual when the claims and litigation represent a probable loss and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is used in determining the timing and amount of the accruals for probable losses, and the actual liability could differ materially from the accrued amounts.  For additional information regarding claims and litigation including self-insurance, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under the caption Claims and Litigation Including Self-insurance.  7. INCOME TAXES  HOW WE DETERMINE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  We file various federal, state and foreign income tax returns, including some returns that are consolidated with subsidiaries. We account for the current and deferred tax effects of such returns using the asset and liability method. Our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our best assessment of the estimated future taxes we will pay. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the current and deferred assets and liabilities. Annually, we compare the liabilities calculated for our federal, state and foreign income tax returns to the estimated liabilities calculated as part of the year end income tax provision. Any adjustments are reflected in our current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.   Part II   51 Table of Contents We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in the income statement. At least quarterly, we assess all positive and negative evidence to determine the likelihood that the deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income. We take into account such factors as:     cumulative losses in recent years     taxable income in prior carryback years, if carryback is permitted under tax law     future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences against deductible temporary differences     tax planning strategies     future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences     the mix of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate  If we were to determine that we would not be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would charge an adjustment to the deferred tax assets to earnings. Conversely, if we were to determine that realization is more likely than not for deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance, the related valuation allowance would be reduced and we would record a benefit to earnings.  FOREIGN EARNINGS  U.S. income taxes are not provided on foreign earnings when such earnings are indefinitely reinvested offshore. We periodically evaluate our investment strategies for each foreign tax jurisdiction in which we operate to determine whether foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested offshore and, accordingly, whether U.S. income taxes should be provided when such earnings are recorded.  UNRECOGNIZED INCOME TAX BENEFITS  We recognize an income tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when, in our judgment, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. For a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we initially and subsequently measure the income tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. Our liability associated with unrecognized income tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law developments and new or emerging legislation. Such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified. Our income tax provision includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as we consider appropriate.  Before a particular matter for which we have recorded a liability related to an unrecognized income tax benefit is audited and finally resolved, a number of years may elapse. The number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits is adequate. Favorable resolution of an unrecognized income tax benefit could be recognized as a reduction in our income tax provision and effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Unfavorable settlement of an unrecognized income tax benefit could increase the income tax provision and effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the period of resolution.  We consider an issue to be resolved at the earlier of settlement of an examination, the expiration of the statute of limitations, or when the issue is effectively settled. Our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits is generally presented as noncurrent. However, if we anticipate paying cash within one year to settle an uncertain tax position, the liability is presented as current. We classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits as income tax expense.  STATUTORY DEPLETION  Our largest permanent item in computing both our effective tax rate and taxable income is the deduction allowed for statutory depletion. The impact of statutory depletion on the effective tax rate is presented in Note 9 Income Taxes in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The deduction for statutory depletion does not necessarily change proportionately to changes in pretax earnings.   Part II   52 Table of Contents NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  For a discussion of accounting standards recently adopted and pending adoption and the affect such accounting changes will have on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under the caption New Accounting Standards.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  The foregoing discussion and analysis, as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report, contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby. See the discussion in Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 in Part I, above.   Part II   53 Table of Contents  ITEM 7A Part II   53 Table of Contents  ITEM 7A   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. In order to manage or reduce these market risks, we may utilize derivative financial instruments. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.  We are exposed to interest rate risk due to our bank line of credit and other long-term debt instruments. At times, we use interest rate swap agreements to manage this risk.  In June 2011, we issued $500.0 million of 6.50% fixed-rate notes due in 2016. Concurrently, we entered into interest rate swap agreements in the stated amount of $500.0 million. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month LIBOR plus a spread of 4.05% and received a fixed interest rate of 6.50%. Additionally, in June 2011, we entered into interest rate swap agreements on our $150.0 million of 10.125% fixed-rate notes due in 2015. Under these agreements, we paid 6-month LIBOR plus a spread of 8.03% and received a fixed interest rate of 10.125%. In August 2011, we terminated and settled these interest rate swap agreements for $25.4 million of cash proceeds. The $23.4 million forward component of the settlement (cash proceeds less $2.0 million of accrued interest) was added to the carrying value of the related debt and is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining lives of the related debt using the effective interest method.  In December 2007, we issued $325.0 million of floating-rate notes due in 2010 that bore interest at 3-month LIBOR plus 1.25% per annum. Concurrently, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the stated amount of $325.0 million. The swap agreement terminated December 15, 2010, coinciding with the maturity of the notes. The realized gains and losses upon settlement related to the swap agreement are reflected in interest expense concurrent with the hedged interest payments on the debt.  At December 31, 2011, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt instruments including current maturities was $2,931.3 million compared to a book value of $2,815.4 million. The estimated fair value was determined by discounting expected future cash flows based on credit-adjusted interest rates on U.S. Treasury bills, notes or bonds, as appropriate. The fair value estimate is based on information available as of the measurement date. Although we are not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amount, it has not been comprehensively revalued since the measurement date. The effect of a decline in interest rates of one percentage point would increase the fair value of our liability by $157.7 million.  We are exposed to certain economic risks related to the costs of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. These economic risks include changes in the discount rate for high-quality bonds, the expected return on plan assets, the rate of compensation increase for salaried employees and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits. The impact of a change in these assumptions on our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs is discussed in greater detail within the Critical Accounting Policies section of this annual report.   Part II   54 Table of Contents  ITEM 8 ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS  There were no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part 1 in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011.   ITEM 4 Part I   2 Table of Contents  ITEM 1   BUSINESS  SUMMARY  Vulcan Materials Company is a New Jersey corporation and the nations largest producer of construction aggregates: primarily crushed stone, sand, and gravel. We have 323 active aggregates facilities. We also are a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete as well as a leading producer of cement in Florida.  STRATEGY FOR EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS     Our reserves are strategically located throughout the United States in high growth areas that will require large amounts of aggregates to meet construction demand. Vulcan-served states are estimated to have 75% of the total growth in the U.S. population and 72% of the total growth in U.S. household formations between 2010 and 2020. Our top ten revenue producing states in 2011 were California, Virginia, Texas, Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Alabama.  U.S. DEMOGRAPHIC GROWTH 2010 TO 2020, TOP 10 BY STATE    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  Note: Vulcan-served states shown in bolded, blue text.   Source: Moodys Analytics as of December 15, 2011     We have pursued a strategy of increasing our presence in metropolitan areas that are expected to grow most rapidly.     We typically operate in locations close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive. Approximately 80% of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively by truck, and another 13% are delivered by truck after reaching a sales yard by rail or water.   Part I   3  Table of Contents MAJOR ACQUISITIONS    [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]    Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. Since 1991 we have acquired over 280 aggregates operations, including many small bolt-on operations and several large acquisitions.  COMPETITORS  We operate in an industry that is very fragmented with a large number of small, privately-held companies. We estimate that the ten largest aggregates producers account for approximately 30% to 35% of the total U.S. aggregates production. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcans total U.S. market share is less than 10%. Other publicly traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:     Cemex S.A.B. de C.V.     CRH plc     HeidelbergCement AG     Holcim Ltd.     Lafarge     Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.     MDU Resources Group, Inc.  Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with over 5,000 companies managing almost 10,000 operations, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by entering new markets or enhancing their market positions by acquiring existing facilities.   Part I   4 Table of Contents BUSINESS STRATEGY  Vulcan provides the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to expand the U.S. economy. Our strategy is based on our strength in aggregates. Aggregates are used in all types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our materials are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and airports that connect us, and to build the hospitals, churches, shopping centers, and factories that are essential to our lives and the economy. The following graphs illustrate the relationship of our four operating segments to sales.  AGGREGATES-LED VALUE CREATION  2011 NET SALES  * Represents sales to external customers of our aggregates and our downstream products that use our aggregates  Our business strategies include: 1) aggregates focus, 2) coast-to-coast footprint, 3) profitable growth, 4) focus on cost reduction, and 5) effective land management.  1. AGGREGATES FOCUS  Aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private construction projects and practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist. Our focus on aggregates allows us to:     BUILD AND HOLD SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES: The locations of our reserves are critical to our long-term success because of barriers to entry created in many metropolitan markets by zoning and permitting regulations and high transportation costs. Our reserves are strategically located throughout the United States in high-growth areas that will require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand. Aggregates operations have flexible production capabilities and require no raw material other than our owned or leased aggregates reserves. Our downstream businesses (asphalt mix and concrete) predominantly use Vulcan-produced aggregates.     TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BEING THE LARGEST PRODUCER: Each aggregates operation is unique because of its location within a local market with particular geological characteristics. Every operation, however, uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service. Vulcan is the largest aggregates company in the U.S., whether measured by production or by revenues. Our 323 active aggregates facilities provide opportunities to standardize and procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in an efficient and cost-effective manner, both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service, accounts receivable and accounts payable, technical support and engineering.   Part I   5 Table of Contents 2. COAST-TO-COAST FOOTPRINT  Demand for construction aggregates positively correlates with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. We have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly.  Our top ten revenue-producing states are predicted to have 69% of the total growth in the U.S. population between 2010 and 2020 while all of the Vulcan-served states are predicted to have 75% of such growth. Much of our reserves are located in areas where zoning and permitting laws have made opening new quarries increasingly difficult. Our diversified geographic locations help insulate Vulcan from variations in regional weather and economies. (Demographic source: Moodys Analytics)  3. PROFITABLE GROWTH  Our growth is a result of acquisitions, cost management and investment activities.     STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS: Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. For example, in 1999 we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California and Arizona and making us one of the nations leading producers of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete.  In 2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., the largest acquisition in our history. This acquisition expanded our aggregates business in Florida and other southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, as well as adding to our ready-mixed concrete business and added cement manufacturing and distribution facilities in Florida.  In addition to these large acquisitions, we have completed many smaller acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth.     REINVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH HIGH RETURNS: During this decade, Moodys Analytics projects that 75% of the U.S. population growth will occur in Vulcan-served states. The close proximity of our production facilities and our aggregates reserves to this projected population growth creates many opportunities to invest capital in high-return projects  projects that will add reserves, increase production capacity and improve costs.   Part I   6 Table of Contents 4. FOCUS ON COST REDUCTION  In a business where aggregates sell, on average, for $10.25 per ton, we are accustomed to rigorous cost management throughout economic cycles. Small savings per ton add up to significant cost reductions. We are able to reduce or expand production and adjust employment levels to meet challenging market demands without jeopardizing our ability to take advantage of future increased demand.  Our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities have allowed us to manage costs aggressively during the recession. In addition to cost reduction steps taken in previous years, in 2011 we made additional reductions in our workforce, adjusted plant operating hours and divested operations in non-strategic markets. These steps did not impact our ability to maintain and, in some cases, improve our per-ton margins. As a result, our cash earnings for each ton of aggregates sold in 2011 was 24% higher than at the peak of demand in 2005.  5. EFFECTIVE LAND MANAGEMENT  We believe that effective land management is both a business strategy and a social responsibility that contributes to our success. Good stewardship requires the careful use of existing resources as well as long-term planning because mining, ultimately, is an interim use of the land. Therefore, we strive to achieve a balance between the value we create through our mining activities and the value we create through effective post-mining land management. We continue to expand our thinking and focus our actions on wise decisions regarding the life cycle management of the land we currently hold and will hold in the future.  PRODUCT LINES  We have four reporting segments organized around our principal product lines:     aggregates     concrete     asphalt mix     cement  1. AGGREGATES  A number of factors affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our business including markets, reserves and demand cycles.     LOCAL MARKETS: Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases, must be produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the materials. Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available high quality aggregates. We serve these markets from inland quarries  shipping by barge and rail  and from our quarry on   Part I   7 Table of Contents     Mexicos Yucatan Peninsula. We transport aggregates from Mexico to the U.S. principally on our three Panamax-class, self-unloading ships.     DIVERSE MARKETS: Large quantities of aggregates are used in virtually all types of public- and private-sector construction projects such as highways, airports, water and sewer systems, industrial manufacturing facilities, residential and nonresidential buildings. Aggregates also are used widely as railroad track ballast.     LOCATION AND QUALITY OF RESERVES: We currently have 15.0 billion tons of permitted and proven or probable aggregates reserves. The bulk of these reserves are located in areas where we expect greater than average rates of growth in population, jobs and households, which require new infrastructure, housing, offices, schools and other development. Such growth requires aggregates for construction. Zoning and permitting regulations in some markets have made it increasingly difficult for the aggregates industry to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. These restrictions could curtail expansion in certain areas, but they also could increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.     DEMAND CYCLES: Long-term growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short- and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries, with each peak establishing a new historical high. In comparison to all other recent demand cycles, the current downturn has been unusually steep and long, making it difficult to predict the timing or strength of future recovery.  Highway construction is the most aggregates-intensive form of construction and residential construction is the least intensive (see table below) relative to a dollar of construction spending. A dollar spent for highway construction is estimated to consume seven times the quantity of aggregates consumed by a dollar spent for residential construction. Other non-highway infrastructure markets like airports, sewer and waste disposal, or water supply plants and utilities also require large quantities of aggregates in their foundations and structures. These types of infrastructure-related construction can be four times more aggregates-intensive than residential construction. Generally, nonresidential buildings require two to three times as much aggregates per dollar of spending as a new home with most of the aggregates used in the foundations, building structure and parking lots.  U.S. AGGREGATES DEMAND BY END-MARKET   Part I   8 Table of Contents In addition, the following factors influence the aggregates market:     HIGHLY FRAGMENTED INDUSTRY: The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of over 5,000 companies that manage almost 10,000 operations. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.     RELATIVELY STABLE DEMAND FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR: Publicly funded construction activity has historically been more stable than privately funded construction. Public construction also has been considerably less cyclical than private construction and generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending. Private construction (primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically is more affected by general economic cycles than public construction. Publicly funded projects (particularly highways, roads and bridges) tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.     LIMITED PRODUCT SUBSTITUTION: With few exceptions, there are no practical substitutes for quality aggregates. In urban locations, recycled concrete has limited applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However, many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete but require the use of virgin aggregates to meet specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities.     WIDELY USED IN DOWNSTREAM PRODUCTS: In the production process, aggregates are processed for specific applications or uses. Two products that use aggregates as a raw material are asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. By weight, aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix and 78% of ready-mixed concrete.     FLEXIBLE PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES: The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Aggregates plants do not require high start-up costs and typically have lower fixed costs than continuous process manufacturing operations. Production capacity can be flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand.     NO RAW MATERIAL INPUTS: Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric power.  OUR MARKETS  We focus on the U.S. markets with the greatest expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or with access to economical transportation to their markets. We serve both the public and the private sectors.  PUBLIC SECTOR  Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state, and local governments for highways, bridges and airports as well as other infrastructure construction for sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources. In 2011, publicly funded construction accounted for approximately 55% of our total aggregates shipments.  PUBLIC SECTOR FUNDING: Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction because public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multi-year legislation and programs. For example, the federal transportation bill is a principal source of funding for public infrastructure and transportation projects. For over two decades, a portion of transportation projects have been funded through a series of multi-year bills. The long-term aspect of these bills is critical because it provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-term and complex highway projects. Federal highway spending is governed by multi-year authorization bills and annual budget appropriations using funds largely from the Federal Highway Trust Fund. This trust receives funding from taxes on gasoline and other levies. The level of state spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies. In 2011, approximately 31% of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects.   Part I   9 Table of Contents CHANGES IN MULTI-YEAR FUNDING: The most recent federal transportation bill, known as SAFETEA-LU, expired on September 30, 2009. Congress has yet to pass a replacement bill. As a result, funds for highway construction have been provided by a series of short-term authorized extensions; the most recent will expire on March 31, 2012. Even with the many budget cuts proposed and made by Congress, in 2011 highway funding levels remained essentially even with Fiscal Year 2010 levels of more than $41 billion annually. In addition, Congress passed its 2012 appropriations bill for highway funding essentially in line with 2011 levels. The Senate and House began floor action on new transportation reauthorization bills the week of February 14, 2012 and are to resume debate following the Presidents Day recess.  NEED FOR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE: A significant need exists for additional and ongoing investments in the nations infrastructure. In 2009, a report by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) gave our nations infrastructure an overall grade of D and estimated that an investment of $2.2 trillion over a five-year period is needed for improvements. While the needs are clear, the source of funding for infrastructure improvements is not. In its report, the ASCE suggests that all levels of government, owners and users need to renew their commitment to infrastructure investments in all categories and that all available financing options should be explored and debated.  FEDERAL STIMULUS IMPACT: The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Stimulus or ARRA) was signed into law on February 17, 2009 to create jobs and restore economic growth through, among other things, the modernization of Americas infrastructure and improving its energy resources. Included in the $787 billion of economic stimulus funding was $50 to $60 billion of heavy construction, including $27.5 billion for highways and bridges. In Vulcan-served states there are approximately $2.8 billion of Stimulus funds remaining to be spent for road construction in 2012 and beyond.  PRIVATE SECTOR  The private sector market includes both nonresidential buildings and residential construction and is more cyclical than public construction. In 2011, privately-funded construction accounted for approximately 45% of our total aggregates shipments.  NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION: Private nonresidential construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction, but less aggregates intensive than public construction. Overall demand in private nonresidential construction is generally driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals, churches and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firms ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing.  Consistent with past cycles of private sector construction, private nonresidential construction activity remained strong after residential construction peaked in 2006. However, in late 2007, contract awards for nonresidential buildings peaked. In 2008, contract awards in the U.S. declined 24% from the prior year and in 2009 fell sharply, declining 56% from 2008 levels. However, after bottoming in 2010, trailing twelve-month contract awards for private nonresidential buildings began to improve in 2011, ending the year up 10% from 2010 levels. This year-over-year increase was attributable to continued strength throughout the year in manufacturing as well as second-half growth in contract awards for stores and office buildings, up 18% and 15%, respectively, at December 31, 2011. Contract awards are a leading indicator of future construction activity and a continuation of the recent trend in awards should translate to growth in demand for aggregates. Employment growth, more attractive lending standards and general recovery in the economy will help drive continued growth in construction activity in this end market.  RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION: The majority of residential construction is for single-family houses with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Household formations in Vulcans markets have grown faster than household formations in the U.S. as a whole in the past decade. During that time, household growth was 13% in our markets compared to 8% in the remainder of the United States. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing. Demand for our products generally occurs early in the infrastructure phase of residential construction and later as part of driveways or parking lots.   Part I   10 Table of Contents U.S. housing starts, as measured by McGraw-Hill data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than 600,000 units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually.  PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY COMPARISON  (Year-over-Year Percent Change in Trailing Twelve Month Contract Awards)  In 2011, total U.S. housing starts increased 1% from the prior year due to a 25% increase in multi-family starts. While these results dont necessarily indicate a sustained recovery in residential construction, the modest improvement in construction activity is encouraging. Lower home prices, attractive mortgage interest rates and fewer existing homes for sale provide some optimism for single-family housing construction in 2012 and beyond, albeit from low levels.  ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS AND MARKETS  We sell ballast to railroads for construction and maintenance of railroad track. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along waterways. In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime.  Our Brooksville, Florida calcium plant produces calcium products for the animal feed, paint, plastics, water treatment and joint compound industries. This facility is supplied with high quality calcium carbonate material mined at the Brooksville quarry.   Part I   11 Table of Contents OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE  We are the largest producer of construction aggregates in the United States. The aggregates market is highly fragmented with many small, independent producers. Therefore, depending on the market, we may compete with large international, national or regional firms as well as relatively small local producers. Because construction aggregates are expensive to transport relative to their value, markets generally are local in nature. Thus, the cost to deliver product to the location where it is used is an important competitive factor.  We serve many metropolitan areas that demographers expect will experience the largest absolute growth in population in the future. A market often consists of a single metropolitan area or one or more counties where transportation from the producing location to the customer is by truck only. Approximately 80% of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively by truck, and another 13% are delivered by truck after reaching a sales yard. Sales yards and other distribution facilities located on waterways and rail lines allow us to reach markets that do not have locally available sources of aggregates.  Zoning and permitting regulations in many metropolitan markets have made it increasingly difficult to expand existing quarries or to develop new quarries. However, such regulations, while potentially curtailing expansion in certain areas, could also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.  We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 Segment Reporting in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  2. CONCRETE  We produce and sell ready-mixed concrete in California, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Texas, Virginia and the District of Columbia. Additionally, we produce and sell, in a limited number of these markets, other concrete products such as block and pre-cast beams. We also resell purchased building materials for use with ready-mixed concrete and concrete block.  This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising approximately 78% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment almost wholly through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.  We serve our Concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck. Because ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility.  Ready-mixed concrete production also requires cement. In the Florida market, cement requirements for ready-mixed concrete production are supplied substantially by our Cement segment. In other markets, we purchase cement from third-party suppliers. We do not anticipate any material difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate.  3. ASPHALT MIX  We produce and sell asphalt mix in Arizona, California, and Texas. This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately 95% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt Mix segment almost wholly through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.  Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility. The asphalt production process requires liquid asphalt cement, which we purchase entirely from third-party producers. We serve our Asphalt Mix segment customers from our local production facilities.   Part I   12 Table of Contents 4. CEMENT  Our Newberry, Florida cement plant produces Portland and masonry cement that we sell in both bulk and bags to the concrete products industry. Our Tampa, Florida distribution facility can import and export cement and slag. Some of the imported cement is resold, and the balance of the cement is blended, bagged, or reprocessed into specialty cements that we then sell. The slag is ground and sold in blended or unblended form.  The Cement segments largest single customer is our own ready-mixed concrete operations within the Concrete segment.  An expansion of production capacity at our Newberry, Florida cement plant was completed in 2010. Total annual production capacity is now at 1.6 million tons per year. This plant is supplied by limestone mined at the facility. These limestone reserves total 191.0 million tons.  OTHER BUSINESS-RELATED ITEMS  SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS  Almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter because of winter weather in the first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector. The levels of construction spending are affected by changing interest rates and demographic and population fluctuations.  CUSTOMERS  No material part of our business is dependent upon any customers whose loss would have an adverse effect on our business. In 2011, our top five customers accounted for 4.7% of our total revenues (excluding internal sales), and no single customer accounted for more than 1.3% of our total revenues. Our products typically are sold to private industry and not directly to governmental entities. Although approximately 45% to 55% of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, relatively insignificant sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly funded construction, our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with state or federal governments.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  We conduct research and development and technical service activities directed toward new and more efficient uses of our products and support customers in pursuing the most efficient use of our products. We spent $1.1 million in 2011, $1.6 million in 2010 and $1.5 million in 2009 on research and development activities.   Part I   13 Table of Contents ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION  Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety; examples include regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both NSHA and OHSA. Compliance with these various regulations requires a substantial capital investment, and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs. We estimate that capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in 2012 and 2013 will be approximately $9.2 million and $11.6 million, respectively. These anticipated expenditures are not expected to have any material impact on our earnings or competitive position.  Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded in our financial statements as a liability at the time the obligation arises. The fair value of such obligations is capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the owned or leased site. The liability is accreted through charges to operating expenses. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. All reclamation obligations are reviewed at least annually. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.  For additional information regarding reclamation obligations (referred to in our financial statements as asset retirement obligations), see Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.  PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS  We do not own or have a license or other rights under any patents, trademarks or trade names that are material to any of our reporting segments.  OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING VULCAN  Vulcan is a New Jersey corporation incorporated on February 14, 2007, but its predecessor company was incorporated on September 27, 1956. Our principal sources of energy are electricity, diesel fuel, natural gas and coal. We do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining sources of energy required for operation of any of our reporting segments (i.e., Aggregates, Concrete, Asphalt Mix and Cement).  As of January 1, 2012, we employed 7,124 people in the U.S. Of these employees, 626 are represented by labor unions. As of that date, we also employed 294 people in Mexico, 226 of which are hourly employees represented by a labor union. We do not anticipate any significant issues with any such unions in 2012.  We do not consider our backlog of orders to be material to, or a significant factor in, evaluating and understanding our business.
