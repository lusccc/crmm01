Business  \\n\\nBackground  \\n\\nCACI International Inc was organized as a Delaware corporation under the name \\x93CACI WORLDWIDE, INC.\\x94 on October 8, 1985. By a merger on June 2, 1986, the registrant became the parent of CACI, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and CACI N.V., a Netherlands corporation. Effective April 16, 2001, CACI, Inc. was merged into its wholly-owned subsidiary, CACI, INC.-FEDERAL, such that the registrant is now the corporate parent of CACI, INC.-FEDERAL, a Delaware corporation, and CACI N.V., a Netherlands corporation. The registrant is a holding company and its operations are conducted through subsidiaries, which are located in the U.S. and Europe, and a joint venture which is controlled by the registrant.  \\n\\nOur telephone number is (703) 841-7800 and our Internet page can be accessed at www.caci.com. We make our web site content available for information purposes only. It should not be relied upon for investment purposes, nor is it incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \\n\\nOur Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are made available free of charge on our Internet website at www.caci.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Documents filed by us with the SEC can also be viewed at www.sec.gov.  \\n\\nOverview  \\n\\nCACI founded its business in 1962 in simulation technology. With revenue for the year ended June 30, 2013 (FY2013) of $3.7 billion, we serve clients in the U.S. federal government and commercial markets, primarily throughout North America and internationally on behalf of U.S. customers, as well as in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the Netherlands. We deliver information solutions and services to our clients. Through our service offerings, we provide comprehensive and practical solutions by adapting emerging technologies and continually evolving legacy strengths. As a result of our diverse capabilities and client mission understanding, many of our client relationships have existed for ten years or more.  \\n\\nOur reliable and high-quality solutions and services have enabled us to successfully compete for and win repeat business, sustain long-term client relationships and compete effectively for new clients and new contracts. We seek competitive business opportunities and have designed our operations to support major programs through centralized business development and business alliances. We have structured our business development organization to respond to the competitive marketplace, particularly within the federal government, and support that activity with full-time marketing, sales, communications, and proposal development specialists.  \\n\\nOur primary customers are agencies of the U.S. government. Our information solutions and services are primarily targeted to the areas of defense, intelligence, homeland security and information technology (IT) modernization in support of national security missions and government transformation. The demand for our services, in large measure, is created by the increasingly complex network, systems and information environments in which governments and businesses operate, and by the need to stay current with emerging technology while increasing productivity and, ultimately, improving performance.  \\n\\nSpending by the U.S. government with contractors who provide services to the Department of Defense (DoD), is being negatively impacted by the country\\x92s fiscal shortfall. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (the Budget Act) established limits on discretionary spending, which will reduce planned defense spending by a minimum of $487 billion over a 10 year period that began with the government\\x92s fiscal year ended September 30, 2012. In addition, the Budget Act included a sequester mechanism that imposed additional defense cuts of $500  \\n\\n3  \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\n billion, or approximately 9 percent, over nine years starting in the government\\x92s fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, if the Congress did not identify a means to reduce the U.S. deficit by $1.2 trillion. Because these means were not identified, the sequester mechanism took effect on March 1, 2013. In light of the Budget Act and deficit reduction pressures, it is likely that discretionary spending by the federal government will remain constrained for a number of years.  \\n\\nThe sequester mechanism, if left unmodified, along with other pressures on government spending, are negatively impacting our business and could have further negative impacts on us in the future. We may experience disruption of existing programs, delays in contract awards, and other actions, including partial or complete contract terminations.  \\n\\nDuring our FY2013, we took steps to make sure our cost structure is in line with our expectations of future business opportunities given the challenging environment for companies in our industry. We believe we are well positioned to win new business in the market areas we focus on, where the government is expected to continue to spend while constrained by sequestration.  \\n\\nAt June 30, 2013, we had approximately 14,900 employees.  \\n\\nDomestic Operations  \\n\\nOur domestic operations account for 100 percent of our U.S. government revenue and 29.2 percent of our commercial revenue. Some of the contracts performed by our domestic operations involve assignment of employees to international locations in support of our federal government clients. At June 30, 2013, approximately 800 employees were on assignments in international locations. We provide our services and solutions to our domestic clients in the following market areas:  \\n\\n   \\x95    Business Systems\\x97Within the Business Systems market, we provide the full range of information solutions and services required to plan, manage, architect, develop, deploy, and sustain the complex, integrated systems that the DoD, the Intelligence Community, and federal civilian agencies need to accomplish their transformation goals and achieve ever-increasing efficiency and effectiveness in their mission functions and business operations.

Our LMR clients include the DoD and military services, the Intelligence Community, federal civilian agencies, and the commercial sector. We provide LMR services in the following disciplines: supply chain management, force health services, maintenance material management, warehousing and distribution, logistics operations, integrated product support, training logistics, and ordnance logistics. We develop and manage logistics information systems and specialized simulation and modeling toolsets and provide logistics engineering services. Our operational capabilities span the supply chain, including advanced logistics planning, demand forecasting, total asset visibility (including the use of radio frequency identification technology), lifecycle support for weapons systems, and supply chain security. We minimize disruption to the supply chain using ISO 27001 and 28000-based supply chain risk management practices. Our logistics services are a critical enabler in support of defense readiness and combat sustainability objectives.  \\n\\nInternational Operations  \\n\\nOur international operations are conducted primarily through our operating subsidiaries in Europe, CACI Limited and CACI BV, and account for substantially all revenue generated from international clients and 70.8 percent of our commercial revenue. CACI\\x92s European operations are headquartered in London, England, and operate primarily in our business systems and enterprise IT market areas.  \\n\\nOur international service offerings deliver a wide range of IT professional services and proprietary products to government and private organizations. Our international operations are engaged in the provision of services for health, education and the social care of children. We also provide network design and management services covering large scale voice and data networks for telcom service providers and corporate enterprises. Our services also include the provision of consulting and proprietary data and software products to enable our clients to find, retain and grow profitable customers through our understanding of consumer characteristics and behavior.  \\n\\nCompetition  \\n\\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that includes many firms, some of which are larger in size and have greater financial resources than we do. We obtain much of our business on the basis of proposals submitted in response to requests from potential and current customers, who may also receive proposals from other firms. Additionally, we face indirect competition from certain government agencies that perform services for  \\n\\n7  \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\n themselves similar to those marketed by us. We know of no single competitor that is dominant in our fields of technology. We have a relatively small share of the available worldwide market for our solutions and services and intend to achieve growth and increasing market share both organically and through strategic acquisitions.  \\n\\nStrengths and Strategy  \\n\\nWe offer substantially our entire range of solutions and services and proprietary products to defense, intelligence and civilian agencies of the U.S. government. Our work for U.S. government agencies may combine a wide range of skills drawn from our solutions, services and product offerings. We also contract through our international operations to supply solutions, services and/or products to governments of other nations. As with other government contractors, our business is subject to government client funding decisions and actions that are beyond our control.  \\n\\nAlthough we are a supplier of proprietary computer-based technology products and marketing systems products, we are not primarily focused on being a software product developer-distributor (see discussion following under \\x93Patents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Licenses\\x94).  \\n\\nOur international commercial client base consists primarily of large enterprises in the U.K. This market is the primary target of our proprietary marketing systems software, and database products and consultancy services. Commercial bids are frequently negotiated as to terms and conditions for schedule, specifications, delivery and payment.  \\n\\nIn order to effectively perform on our existing client contracts and secure new client contracts within the U.S. government, we must maintain expert knowledge of agency policies, operations and challenges. We combine this comprehensive knowledge with significant expertise in the design, integration, development and implementation of advanced information solutions and services. This capability provides us with opportunities either to compete directly for, or to support other bidders in competition for, multi-million dollar and multi-year award contracts from the U.S. government.  \\n\\nWe have strategic business relationships with a number of companies associated with the information technology industry. These strategic partners have business objectives compatible with ours and offer products and services that complement ours. We intend to continue development of these kinds of relationships wherever they support our growth objectives.  \\n\\nOur marketing and new business development is conducted by many of our officers and managers including the Chief Executive Officer, executive officers, vice presidents and division managers. We employ marketing professionals who identify and qualify major contract opportunities, primarily in the federal government market.  \\n\\nMuch of our business is won through submission of formal competitive bids. Government and commercial clients typically base their decisions regarding contract awards on their assessment of the quality of past performance, responsiveness to proposal requirements, price, and other factors. The terms, conditions and form of contract of government bids, however, are in most cases specified by the client. In situations in which the client-imposed contract type and/or terms appear to expose us to inappropriate risk or do not offer us a sufficient financial return, we may seek alternate arrangements or opt not to bid for the work. Essentially all contracts with the U.S. government, and many contracts with other government entities, permit the government client to terminate the contract at any time for the convenience of the government or for default by the contractor. Although we operate under the risk that such terminations may occur and have a material impact on operations, such terminations have been rare and, generally, have not materially affected operations.  \\n\\nOur contracts and subcontracts are composed of a wide range of contract types, including firm fixed-price, cost reimbursement, time-and-materials (T&M), indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) and government wide acquisition contracts (known as GWACS) such as General Services Administration (GSA) schedule contracts. By company policy, significant fixed-price contracts require the approval of at least two of our senior officers.  \\n\\n8  \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nAt any one time, we may have several thousand separate active contracts and/or task orders. In FY2013, the ten top revenue-producing contracts, many of which consist of many task orders, accounted for 40.7 percent of our revenue, or $1.5 billion.  \\n\\nIn FY2013, 94.4 percent of our revenue came from U.S. government prime contracts or subcontracts consisting of 74.3 percent from DoD contracts and 20.1 percent from U.S. government civilian agency clients.  \\n\\nIndustry Trends  \\n\\nThe federal government is a large and sophisticated user of information technology. The nation\\x92s expenditures on military, homeland security, and intelligence operations are substantially larger than those of any of its allies or adversaries. Budgets for these operations have nearly doubled since the terrorist attacks in 2001. We believe that the following trends will impact the federal government\\x92s future spending on the types of services we provide:  \\n\\n   \\x95    As combat operations in Afghanistan draw to a close and reduction of the national debt and annual budget deficits under the Budget Act are implemented, discretionary spending by the government is declining. Unless the 2011 law is amended or replaced by other legislation, sequestration of discretionary spending will occur through the government\\x92s fiscal year 2021.  \\n\\n   \\x95    Technology Market Drivers\\x97The widespread use and the complexity of technology and applications will continue to rapidly evolve. There are four categories of the most significant technologies and application areas that we expect to drive the markets in which we participate. These categories are C4ISR, intelligence expertise, cyber solutions, and federal healthcare IT.  \\n\\n   \\x95    Market Opportunities  \\n\\n   \\x95    Government Wide Market Opportunities\\x97As federal government agencies seek to make spending reductions, opportunities to achieve cost reductions through improved operational efficiency will receive higher priority. Many IT initiatives emerging in both DoD and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed programs for civilian agencies are based on infrastructure consolidation and cost effective upgrades. These initiatives include infrastructure modernization, adoption of innovative commercial applications, and increased use of commercially provided infrastructure.  \\n\\nWe continue to expect to see a steady stream of funding for transformational activities that yield results in a shorter timeframe to maximize investments with more stable and predictable information system outcomes. As the amount of data and information grows, and persistent threats to our national security continue, the demands for applications will grow as well, putting a higher value on faster and more efficient/effective technologies. We expect this demand to result in an increasing need for rapid deployment of cyber solutions, cloud computing, and mobile applications. An additional area of cyber emphasis is the security of the supply chain. While technology provides part of the answer, the integration of processes and personnel using forward-looking systems and sound architectures is more likely to provide cost savings and performance efficiencies.  \\n\\n   \\x95    National Security Market Opportunities  \\n\\n   \\x95    Counterterrorism, counter proliferation, cyber security, and counterintelligence are at the immediate forefront of U.S. security concerns and they are all inextricably linked. Additionally, man-made and natural disasters are routinely addressed by applying the military and civilian resources of the U.S.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The world is increasingly interconnected and interdependent. Instability can arise quickly and spread rapidly beyond borders. This phenomenon is readily apparent in events in the Pacific Rim, the Middle East and North Africa. As the U.S. reduces its conventional defense forces, as expected, the need for intelligence and surveillance of potential adversaries of all types will continue or grow.  \\n\\n9  \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\n   \\x95    It is likely that the Middle East will continue to be unstable even as U.S. national security organizations are executing a strategic shift toward Asia-Pacific. This shift will create opportunities as well as threats as the contractor community adapts to the changing needs of Defense, Intelligence, Homeland Security, State, and U.S. partners.  \\n\\n   \\x95    Funding to support the use of military and intelligence assets, particularly special operating forces, to combat these threats is not likely to change dramatically.  \\n\\n   \\x95    Logistics and force protection operations will continue. We anticipate a continuing need to re-set and modernize equipment and infrastructure as forces return from deployments.  \\n\\n   \\x95    Non-Security Market Opportunities  \\n\\n   \\x95    The intersection of law enforcement and intelligence is expected to continue to create opportunities in support of the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The intersection of compatible needs between the Veteran\\x92s Administration and the DoD should continue to fuel opportunities related to healthcare IT.  \\n\\n   \\x95    As budgets are diverted from weapons systems platforms to system upgrades and enhanced services for the non-combat warfighter, increasing competitive pressures from large aerospace firms and traditional original equipment manufacturing companies are anticipated. Non-traditional players have entered the market and have established positions related to such areas as cloud computing, cyber, satellite operations, business systems and healthcare IT. Moreover, commercial off-the shelf software solutions are gradually replacing government developed systems.  \\n\\n   \\x95    As companies strive to expand by increasing market share, there is increasing competition for acquisition candidates. Niche players in cyber, healthcare and intelligence analysts are in particularly high demand.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The government has mandated changes to the manner in which it purchases goods and services. The aspects of this mandate that are most relevant to us are as follows:  \\n\\n   \\x95    The increased emphasis on the use of low priced, technically acceptable proposal evaluations represents a challenge to maintain value added differentiation to our solutions.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The use of time and material and sole-source contracts is now greatly reduced. The use of award fees is diminishing. In addition, more scrutiny is being placed on the amount of fee bid on cost reimbursable type contracts.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The increased engagement by competition advocates maximizes the use of multiple-source, continuously competitive contracts.  \\n\\n   \\x95    Fees for subcontract management are being limited to reflect actual value provided, i.e., risk assumed by prime and continuous subcontractor risk reduction.  \\n\\n   \\x95    In many cases, periods of performance on task orders are being limited to two years and periods for contracts are being limited to four years.  \\n\\n   \\x95    Size thresholds for small business have been revised upward so as to include businesses that currently exceed revenue thresholds.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The government\\x92s management of cash may slow the timing of payment of our invoices.  \\n\\nRecent Significant Acquisitions  \\n\\nDuring the past three fiscal years, we completed a total of eleven acquisitions, eight in the U.S. and three supporting our international operations, including:  \\n\\n   \\x95    The December 31, 2012 acquisition of IDL Solutions, Inc., a provider of information technology solutions, applications, and mission-critical systems support to healthcare IT clients and other civilian agencies, for $21.5 million.  \\n\\n10  \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\n   \\x95    The November 30, 2012 acquisition of Emergint Technologies, Inc., a provider of emerging technology solutions focused on the data-driven needs of national health organizations, for $36.0 million.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The July 2, 2012 acquisition of Delta Solutions and Technologies, Inc., a provider of financial management and business services to the federal government, for $42.5 million.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The October 3, 2011 acquisition of Advanced Programs Group, LLC, a provider of Oracle e-Business Services to the U.S. government, for $66.0 million.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The September 1, 2011 acquisition of Paradigm Solutions Corporation, a provider of cybersecurity and enterprise IT solutions to clients in federal civilian agencies, the DoD, and the Intelligence Community, for $61.5 million.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The July 1, 2011 acquisition of Pangia Technologies, LLC, a software engineering services company that provides technical solutions in the areas of computer network operations, information assurance, mission systems, software and systems engineering, and IT infrastructure support, for $41.0 million.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The November 2010 acquisition of Applied Systems Research, Inc., a provider of technical services and products to the U.S. government, for $25.1 million.  \\n\\n   \\x95    The November 2010 acquisition of TechniGraphics, Inc., a provider of imaging and geospatial services to the U.S. government, for $104.6 million.  \\n\\nSeasonal Nature of Business  \\n\\nOur business in general is not seasonal, although the summer and holiday seasons affect our revenue because of the impact of holidays and vacations on our labor and on product and service sales by our international operations. Variations in our business also may occur at the expiration of major contracts until such contracts are renewed or new business obtained.  \\n\\nThe U.S. government\\x92s fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. It is not uncommon for government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of a fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended funds. Moreover, in years when the U.S. government does not complete the budget process for the next fiscal year before the end of September, government operations whose appropriations legislation has not been signed into law are funded under a continuing resolution that authorizes them to continue to operate, but traditionally does not authorize new spending initiatives.  \\n\\nCACI Employment and Benefits  \\n\\nOur employees are our most valuable resource. We are in continuing competition for highly skilled professionals in virtually all of our business areas. The success and growth of our business is significantly correlated with our ability to recruit, train, promote and retain high quality people at all levels of the organization. For these reasons, we endeavor to maintain competitive salary structures, incentive compensation programs, fringe benefits, opportunities for growth, and individual recognition and award programs. Fringe benefits are generally consistent across our subsidiaries, and include paid vacations, sick leave and holidays; medical, dental, disability and life insurance; tuition reimbursement for job-related education and training; and other benefits under various retirement savings and stock purchase plans.  \\n\\nWe have published policies that set high standards for the conduct of our business. We require all of our employees, independent contractors working on client engagements, officers, and directors annually to execute and affirm to the code of ethics applicable to their activities. In addition, we require annual ethics and compliance training for all of our employees to provide them with the knowledge necessary to maintain our high standards of ethics and compliance.  \\n\\n11  \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nPatents, Trademarks, Trade Secrets and Licenses  \\n\\nWe own 11 patents and patent applications in the United States. While we believe our patents are valid, we do not consider that our business is dependent on patent protection in any material way. We claim copyright, trademark and other proprietary rights in a variety of intellectual property, including each of our proprietary computer software and data products and the related documentation. We presently own 22 registered trademarks and service marks and applications in the U.S. and 32 registered trademarks and service marks in other countries, primarily the U.K. All of our registered trademarks and service marks may be renewed indefinitely. In addition, we assert copyrights in essentially all of our electronic and hard copy publications, proprietary software and data products, which rights can be maintained for up to 75 years. Because most of our business involves providing services to government entities, our operations generally are not substantially dependent upon obtaining and/or maintaining copyright or trademark protections, although our operations make use of such protections and benefit from them as discriminators in competition. We are also a party to agreements that give us the right to distribute computer software, data and other products owned by other companies, and to receive income from such distribution. As a systems integrator, it is important that we maintain access to software, data and products supplied by such third parties, but we generally have experienced little difficulty in doing so. The durations of such agreements vary according to the terms of the agreements themselves.  \\n\\nWe maintain a number of trade secrets that contribute to our success and competitive distinction and endeavor to accord such trade secrets protection adequate to ensure their continuing availability to us. From time to time, we are required to assert our rights against former employees or other third parties who attempt to misappropriate our trade secrets and confidential information for their own personal or professional gain. We take such matters seriously and pursue claims against such individuals to the extent necessary to adequately protect our rights. While retaining protection of our trade secrets and vital confidential information is important, we are not materially dependent on maintenance of a specific trade secret.  \\n\\nBacklog  \\n\\nOur total backlog as of June 30, 2013, which consists primarily of contracts with the U.S. government, was $6.9 billion, of which $1.7 billion was for funded orders. Total backlog as of June 30, 2012 was $7.2 billion. We presently anticipate, based on current revenue projections, that the majority of the funded backlog as of June 30, 2013 will result in revenue during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014.  \\n\\nOur backlog represents the aggregate contract revenue we estimate will be earned over the remaining life of our contracts. We include in estimated remaining contract value only the contract revenue we expect to earn over the remaining term of the contract, even in cases where more than one company is awarded work under a given contract. Funded backlog is based upon amounts appropriated by a customer for payment for goods and services and as the U.S. government operates under annual appropriations, agencies of the U.S. government generally fund contracts on an incremental basis. As a result, the majority of our estimated remaining contract value is not funded backlog. The estimates used to compile remaining contract value are based on our experience under contracts, and we believe the estimates are reasonable. However, there can be no assurance that existing contracts will result in earned revenue in any future period or at all.  \\n\\nBusiness Segments, Foreign Operations, and Major Customers  \\n\\nAdditional business segment, foreign operations and major customer information is provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Report. In particular, see Note 16, Business Segment, Customer and Geographic Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \\n\\n12  \\n\\nTable of Contents \\n\\nRevenue by Contract Type  \\n\\nThe following information is provided on the amounts of our revenue attributable to cost reimbursable contracts, firm fixed-price contracts (including proprietary software product sales) and T&M contracts during each of the last three fiscal years:  \\n\\n  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] \\n\\nItem 1A.
